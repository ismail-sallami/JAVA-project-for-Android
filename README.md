Android Project
===========

This application connects to Goeurp API to get countries list.
The application gets the current location by the GPS and asks to turn it on if it is switched off. 
The HTTPs request returns a JSON array of countries that will be sorted by distance to the current location then displayed in the autocomplete list. The user can choose his language that will be transmitted as parameter in the request to get the suitable countries list. 
The current date is displayed by default and an Imagebutton allows the user to choose another date.
A control for valid date is implemented.
